# Dasmeta EKS Infrastructure Task - Completion Report

## Task Overview
I will finish this task no matter what, since it was a very challenging but interesting task. I have a lot to learn about K8s and how Cloudwatch expects you to send data to it.
I was given a comprehensive infrastructure task to create an EKS cluster with monitoring, logging, and application deployment capabilities. This document outlines the current progress and remaining work.

## ✅ Completed Components

### 1. **EKS Cluster Creation with Terraform**
- ✅ EKS cluster `dasmeta` deployed in `eu-north-1` region
- ✅ 2 spot nodes configured (minimal instance types)
- ✅ Cluster operational with Kubernetes v1.31.12-eks-e386d34
- ✅ Terraform module implementation complete


### 2. **Application Deployment**
- ✅ NGINX application deployed using Terraform `helm_release` resource
- ✅ Bitnami NGINX Helm chart with metrics enabled
- ✅ Application running successfully in `default` namespace
- ✅ Pod status: `nginx-5bb59dc876-n78p7` (Running, 2/2 ready)


### 3. **ADOT (AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry) Installation**
- ✅ ADOT collector pods deployed and operational
- ✅ Components: `adot-container-ci-collector-5q2bz` and `adot-container-ci-collector-vwhj8`
- ⚠️ **In Progress**: Configuration to scrape and send metrics and logs to CloudWatch

### 4. **Prometheus and Grafana Deployment**
- ✅ Deployed using kube-prometheus-stack
- ✅ Prometheus operational for metrics collection
- ✅ Grafana dashboard platform ready
- ✅ Integration configured between Prometheus and Grafana



## 🚧 In Progress Components

### 6. **CloudWatch Integration**
- ⚠️ ADOT configuration for NGINX metrics export to CloudWatch
- ⚠️ CloudWatch dashboard creation for application metrics


### 7. **ALB Controller & Domain Exposure**
- ⚠️ AWS Load Balancer Controller installation
- ⚠️ Public domain configuration for NGINX application
- ⚠️ DNS and SSL certificate setup

## 📋 Remaining Tasks

### 8. **Slack Alerting Configuration**
- 📌 Slack webhook integration
- 📌 Alert rules for application and infrastructure monitoring
- 📌 Notification channels setup in both Prometheus and CloudWatch

### 9. **External Health Monitoring**
- 📌 External health check implementation for public domain
- 📌 Uptime monitoring configuration
- 📌 Health check alert integration

### 10. **Load Testing**
- 📌 Load testing tool selection and setup
- 📌 Performance benchmarking
- 📌 Stress testing documentation

## Infrastructure Components Status
